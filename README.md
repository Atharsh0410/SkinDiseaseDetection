# SkinDiseaseDetection
Overview
This project focuses on the detection of skin diseases using deep learning techniques EfficentNNetV3 and using transfer learning. The main objective is to develop a model that can accurately classify various skin conditions based on input images. The project utilizes deep learning algorithms to analyze skin lesions and provide diagnostic insights.
